# Snake-Game
 A simple snake game built using pygame module in python.<br>

 You can use `W` `A` `S` `D` or <button>&uarr;</button> <button>&larr;</button> <button>&darr;</button> <button>&rarr;</button> to move the snake in different directions.
 
 The game runs better in Ubuntu.<br>
### Install `pygame`
 ```bash
 sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
 ```
 Run the game after installing the package


## TODO<br>
- [ ] There is a `BUG` in the code. It has been commented out. Would like to get help with this issue.
- [x] Define a `pause_game()` method which will pause the game when `SPACE` is pressed.
- [x] Define `restart_game()` method which will restart the game when `ENTER` is pressed.
